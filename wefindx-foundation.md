# Introduction

We are a not-for-profit organization [registered](https://wefindx.com/) in Ireland, dedicated to solving world's equation `f(x)=y`, where `f` - is the world, `y` - is our collective dream, and `x` is our actions to realize it. We are convinced, that the equation model is so general that it will transcend even a superintelligence, and therefore, it is an imperative for humanity to collectively define the right side of the equation `f(x)=y`.

We fund systems to help advance this mission.

## What We Value?

Among the things that we value, are `deep and sincere connections` between people and organizations, balance between `collective and personal freedom`, `passion`, `rationality`, `creativity`, `curiosity`.

We aspire to work together with those who care about the world's greatest challenges, and dare to conceptualize far-reaching solutions to solve them for good.

### What We Fund?

We primarily focus on development and support of the **Infinity Project** - an `economic and innovation forum and platform`, its theoretical development, and the `high-impact ideas` and projects on it, to create `open source solutions` \(primarily, `language and protocol-level` innovations, but also certain `hardware solutions`\).

Please, read our report.

## How We Decide?

We work under _vetocracy_, - goals and ideas can be falsified by any single participant, just like in science and mathematics, where a rule can be falsified by a single observation that does not match theory. Pragmatic implications we follow in such cases:

1. Idea was misunderstood,
2. Idea was not desired truly.

In such cases:

We deeply refine the ideas and learn from/educate the participants that falsify them.

## The Collective

We are part of the global **Infinity Family **\(a group of organisations and individuals with a shared mission - to create the world, where every _true\*_ wish comes true\).
