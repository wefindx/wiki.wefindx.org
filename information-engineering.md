# Information Engineering

Information engineering can be thought of as a process, whereby information sources are combined to form of information collective. For example, different brains communicating or being connected in a specific way that forms a mind may be an example of information engineering. Society's I/O systems connecting in certain specific ways may also form a long-term pattern that describes the society as a mind.
