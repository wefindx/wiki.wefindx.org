# Research Reader and Subscriptions

The research reader is a tool to aggregate sources of news to analyze into a single database of media, that then can be used for deeper analysis. At this point, we provide [reader.wefindx.org](https://reader.wefindx.org) \(running [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org)\) as such. Please, send e-mail to \`hello@wefindx.org\` to get an account.

The latest subscriptions can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wefindx/subscriptions/master/feeds/feeds_2019-03-04.opml.xml), and imported to the reader. You can import the feeds into any reader you prefer.

Also, feel free to contribute to sources by creating a pull request to [subscriptions](https://github.com/wefindx/subscriptions) repository.
