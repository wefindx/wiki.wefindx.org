# INFINITY FAMILY

## WHO WE ARE?

We are a group of organizations and individuals around the world, with a shared mission - `to create the world, where every true* wish comes true`, we paraphrase it as - "Let Everything Exist!"

## TRUE\* WISH?

Our wishes change with more information about their implications. For example, Einstein's wish to share the understanding of theoretical physics might have changed with respect to the use of the nuclear weapons on other humans.

A `true* wish`, is an ideal wish, that that would still hold true, if we explored all the histories of all possible universes, with respect to all possible entities of those universes.

While it is next to impossible to check whether something is a `true* wish` by this definition, implies the process of verification, spanning increasingly large number of entities, and weighted them based on the criterion to decide the `universal good`.

From here follows our vetocratic governance model, conforming with scientific falsifiability ideas:

A `wish` can be falsified by any single participant, just like in science and mathematics, where a rule can be falsified by a single observation that does not match theory, and it implies harmonizing communication to create the `true wish` together.

## HOW DO WE SEEK OUR MISSION

We are constructing a language for collective goal setting and pursuit, and building software implementations to help apply that language, such as the Infinity Project \( [https://infty.xyz](https://infty.xyz) \) - economic and innovation forum and platform.

## BE PART OF THE COLLECTIVE

If you or your organization like to join us, get to know us, and cooperate in pursuit of creating the ideal world, where all of everyone's true\* dreams come true, welcome to join us.
