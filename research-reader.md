# Research Reader and Subscriptions

The research reader is a tool to aggregate sources of news to analyze into a single database of media, that then can be used for deeper analysis. At this point, we are using [reader.wefindx.org](https://reader.wefindx.org) \(running [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org)\) as such, and the latest subscriptions can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wefindx/subscriptions/master/feeds/feeds_2019-03-04.opml.xml). You can import the feeds into the reader after you install or get account on FreshRSS.

You can contribute the valuable sources by creating a PR to [subscriptions](https://github.com/wefindx/subscriptions) repository to include or exclude the reading resources .
