# About

WeFindX Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation with a purpose to solve problems.

We use emerging technology and new business models to provide a transparent and collaborative solution to tackle world’s greatest challenges, such as social and environmental problems and existential risks.

Our technology is multilingual and open source. We’re a mission-driven not-for-profit organisation that operates as a distributed non-hierarchical multi-cultural team.

Buzzwords aside, we're a group of curious agile scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs with a motivation to create a better future for all.

We provide a mechanism for collaboration between individuals and organisations that develop emerging technologies for good. With our web platform, The Infinity Project, it's easy to discuss global challenges, evaluate innovations and implement open projects. Our platform serves as a tool for self-directed learning, problem-based work and meaningful communication.
