# About

WeFindX Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation with a purpose to solve problems. 

We use emerging technology and new business models to provide a transparent and collaborative solution to tackle world’s greatest challenges, such as social and environmental problems and existential risks.

Our technology is multilingual and open source. We’re a mission-driven not-for-profit organisation that operates as a distributed non-hierarchical multi-cultural team.

Buzzwords aside, we're a group of curious agile scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs with a motivation to create a better future for all.
