We provide a mechanism for collaboration between individuals and organisations that develop emerging technologies for good. With our web platform, The Infinity Project, it's easy to discuss global challenges, evaluate innovations and implement open projects. Our platform serves as a tool for self-directed learning, problem-based work and meaningful communication.
